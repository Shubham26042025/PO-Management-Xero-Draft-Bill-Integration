# BA BRD Creation Standard

This rule governs how Business Requirements Documents (BRDs) are created for this project. Follow the Satva template structure and transcript-first approach.

## Source of Truth (Mandatory)

- Assume a meeting recording transcript exists in the "Meeting Recording" folder.
- The transcript is the primary source of truth for requirements, confirmations, scope, and decisions.
- If transcript and other notes conflict, transcript wins. Flag conflicts under Open Questions/Risks.

## Transcript Extraction Checklist

Before writing a BRD, scan the transcript and extract:

1. Confirmed Requirements (client-approved statements)
2. In Scope vs Out of Scope confirmations
3. Business rules & validations (limits, constraints, approvals, roles)
4. Integrations + data sync expectations (what, when, direction)
5. Reporting needs (what reports, frequency, audiences)
6. Non-functional expectations (audit logs, security, performance, error visibility)
7. Dependencies (client inputs, third parties, API access)
8. Timelines/Phasing (sprints, milestones)
9. Open Questions / Unclear items

## Discovery Questions Rule

- Ask discovery questions ONLY for gaps after transcript extraction.
- Do not assume missing requirements. If unclear, list as Open Question or Assumption (needs confirmation).

## BRD Structure (Satva Template)

BRD must follow this structure exactly:

1. Acknowledgment
2. Requirement Discussed
3. Solution Suggested
4. Development Flow
5. Assumptions/Constraints
6. Next Steps

## Writing & Formatting Rules

- Every section must start with a short paragraph (2–4 sentences). No bullet-only sections.
- Use professional, client-facing language.
- Keep statements testable and specific (avoid "should", "etc.", "as needed").
- Clearly separate "Client Confirmed" vs "Assumed/To Confirm".
- End BRD with a clean list of Open Questions (if any) and explicit Next Steps.

## Quality Gate

BRD must include: scope boundaries, key workflows, integrations, assumptions/constraints, and next actions.

**If transcript is missing/not provided, do not proceed.** Request transcript or key decisions.

## Document Storage Location

All BRD documents **MUST** be saved to: `BA Docs/Business Requirement Document/`

See the BA Document Storage Locations rule for complete folder structure requirements.
