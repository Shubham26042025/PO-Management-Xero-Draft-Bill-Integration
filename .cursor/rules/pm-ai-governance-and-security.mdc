# Cursor AI Rules for Project Managers with Security Standards

## Objective

Define strict governance and operating rules for using Cursor AI in the Project Management lifecycle, including security standards. Cursor is used for analysis, review, planning, and decision support **without modifying the codebase** or impacting engineering workflows.

---

## Core Philosophy

Cursor is a **decision-support and analysis tool**, not a coding or development tool for Project Managers.

**PMs must focus on:**
- Clarity
- Risk visibility
- Planning accuracy
- Stakeholder alignment
- Quality governance

**PMs must NOT:**
- Change or generate production code
- Push commits
- Modify repositories
- Change system architecture
- Override technical decisions without consultation

All technical implementation remains the responsibility of Development and QA teams.

---

## Rule 1: Read-Only Interaction

- Cursor must be used in **read-only or review mode**.
- PMs can analyze, review, and understand code but **must not alter it**.

**Allowed:** Code understanding, architecture review, risk detection, dependency analysis.

**Not Allowed:** Editing files, writing production logic, changing configuration.

---

## Rule 2: Requirement and Scope Validation

PMs must use Cursor to:
- Validate requirement completeness
- Identify missing use cases
- Highlight ambiguity
- Compare scope versions

All findings must be documented and shared with stakeholders.

---

## Rule 3: Risk and Dependency Governance

Cursor must be used to:
- Identify technical, functional, and integration risks
- Detect external dependencies
- Highlight bottlenecks
- Suggest mitigation strategies

PMs must maintain a risk log and update it regularly.

---

## Rule 4: Estimation and Timeline Review

Cursor should support:
- Complexity analysis
- Effort validation
- Detection of underestimation
- Buffer recommendations

Final estimation must be approved by Development leads.

---

## Rule 5: Architecture Awareness (Without Control)

PMs should:
- Understand high-level architecture
- Review scalability and maintainability
- Identify integration risks

PMs must NOT:
- Enforce architectural changes
- Directly instruct technical refactoring

All suggestions must go through technical review.

---

## Rule 6: Quality Governance

PMs must use Cursor to:
- Identify critical user flows
- Detect potential edge cases
- Ensure test coverage awareness

PMs should collaborate with QA teams for validation.

---

## Rule 7: Decision Support and Trade-offs

Cursor can be used to:
- Compare technical or business options
- Highlight risks and benefits
- Provide structured decision frameworks

PMs remain accountable for decisions.

---

## Rule 8: Documentation Excellence

Cursor should be used to:
- Review project documentation
- Improve clarity
- Detect gaps
- Create structured summaries

All final documentation must be reviewed by domain experts.

---

## Rule 9: Stakeholder Communication

Cursor can assist in:
- Drafting status reports
- Executive summaries
- Client updates
- Simplifying technical language

Final communication must be validated by PMs.

---

## Rule 10: Data Security and Compliance

**Strictly prohibited:**
- Uploading confidential client data
- Sharing credentials
- Sharing proprietary algorithms
- Using AI tools for sensitive or PII data without masking

**Mandatory Security Standards:**
1. Encrypt all sensitive data during upload and storage.
2. Use secure authentication for AI tools.
3. Maintain access logs for AI interactions.
4. Ensure no AI outputs contain raw sensitive information.
5. Periodically audit AI data usage.

Sensitive information must always be masked.

---

## Rule 11: Transparency and Auditability

PMs must:
- Document AI usage
- Maintain decision traceability
- Record AI-assisted recommendations

This ensures governance and accountability.

---

## Rule 12: Collaboration with Teams

PMs must:
- Share AI insights with Dev, QA, and BA
- Encourage cross-functional validation
- Avoid unilateral decisions

---

## Rule 13: Continuous Learning

PMs should:
- Improve prompt quality
- Build reusable prompt libraries
- Share best practices across teams

---

## Best Practices

1. Use Cursor early in the project lifecycle.
2. Validate outputs with experts.
3. Avoid overdependence on AI.
4. Maintain critical thinking.
5. Focus on outcomes, not tools.
6. Follow all security standards strictly.

---

## Expected Benefits

- Better project predictability
- Reduced risks
- Faster decision-making
- Improved delivery governance
- Enhanced stakeholder confidence
- Stronger security and compliance posture

---

## Outcome

A structured, governed, and secure AI-powered Project Management approach that enhances visibility, clarity, delivery excellence, and security without interfering with engineering workflows.
