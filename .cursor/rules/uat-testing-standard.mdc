# UAT Testing Standard

This rule governs how User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is executed for this project. All UAT must be based on FRD, sprint plan, and UAC documents.

## Mandatory Prerequisites

Before executing UAT:

1. **FRD must be available** in `BA Docs/Functional Requirement Document/`
2. **Sprint plan** must clearly identify sprint deliverables
3. **UAC CSV** must be available in `BA Docs/User Stories and Acceptance Criteria/`
4. **Application must be deployed** to UAT/staging environment
5. **Credentials must be configured** securely (environment variables, not hardcoded)

## Test Execution Requirements

### Document-Based Testing

- All test scenarios **MUST** be derived from UAC CSV
- Test coverage **MUST** align with FRD functional requirements
- Only sprint-scope items **MUST** be tested (exclude out-of-scope)

### Test Coverage Per Module

Each module in sprint scope must include:

- ✅ Positive test scenarios (happy path)
- ✅ Negative test scenarios (error handling)
- ✅ Edge cases (boundary conditions)
- ✅ Role-based tests (permissions, access control)
- ✅ Validation tests (business rules, constraints)
- ✅ Integration tests (third-party syncs, data flows)

### Test Execution Order

1. **Prerequisites**: Login, data setup, environment validation
2. **Core Workflows**: Main user journeys per FRD
3. **Validations**: Business rules and constraints
4. **Integrations**: External system interactions
5. **Cleanup**: Reset state if needed

## Validation Against Acceptance Criteria

- Each UAC row **MUST** have a corresponding test case
- Test results **MUST** validate against expected outcomes
- Binary outcomes (Yes/No) **MUST** be verified explicitly
- Evidence **MUST** be captured (screenshots, API responses, logs)

## Test Reporting

### Mandatory Report Sections

- Test summary (total, passed, failed, blocked, pass rate)
- Detailed test execution results per module
- Failed tests with evidence and notes
- Blocked tests with reasons
- Recommendations and next steps

### Report Storage

All test reports **MUST** be saved to: `BA Docs/Test Reports/`

Use naming convention: `UAT_Report_Sprint[X]_[Date].md`

## Automation Requirements

- Prefer automated test execution over manual testing
- Use appropriate tools (browser automation for web, API clients for APIs)
- Implement retry logic for flaky tests
- Capture evidence automatically (screenshots, responses)

## Security Requirements

- **Never hardcode credentials** in test scripts
- Use environment variables or secure credential storage
- Do not commit credentials to version control
- Rotate test credentials regularly

## Post-Testing Actions

1. **Document results** in test report
2. **Flag issues** for development team
3. **Track fixes** and retest failed cases
4. **Maintain history** per sprint

## Integration with Development Workflow

- UAT runs **after** development completion
- Results shared with development team
- Failed tests tracked until resolution
- Test history maintained for regression analysis
