# Project Standards and Code Review

## Code Review – Review Only, No Changes

- **Do not change code** – We only review the codebase; we do not modify it.
- Code review is for **assessment, feedback, and recommendations** only.
- Output findings, suggestions, and observations without proposing edits to the code.
- Do not suggest or apply code changes; provide feedback for the team to act on.

## Security Standards

- Follow applicable **security standards** (OWASP, data protection, secure coding).
- Ensure recommendations align with security best practices when reviewing.
- Flag security concerns in findings; do not introduce vulnerabilities.

## PMBOK and Project Management Institute (PMI)

- Align with **PMBOK** (Project Management Body of Knowledge) best practices.
- Follow **Project Management Institute (PMI)** standards for planning, execution, monitoring, and closure.
- Apply PMI principles to governance, risk, stakeholder, and scope management.

## Agile and Scrum Best Practices

- Follow **Agile** principles (incremental delivery, collaboration, responsiveness to change).
- Apply **Scrum** best practices for sprints, ceremonies, roles, and artifacts.
- Ensure recommendations support iterative development and continuous improvement.

## Team Parallel Execution

- **The entire team works in parallel** – not a single person; the team executes tasks concurrently.
- Developers, QA, BA, and multiple developers can and should do tasks **in parallel**.
- Plan and allocate work so that Developer 1, Developer 2, QA, and BA can work on different tasks simultaneously.
- Avoid serializing the whole team; maximize parallel execution across roles and developers.
- Sprint planning and task assignment must enable concurrent work across the team.

## Integration Standards

- Follow **basic integration standards** for APIs, data exchange, and system connections.
- Align with REST/SOAP conventions, error handling, and integration patterns.
- Ensure integration design and review respect consistency, reliability, and maintainability.

## Don't

- Don't modify or propose edits to the codebase; review and advise only.
- Don't bypass security standards in recommendations.
- Don't contradict PMBOK, PMI, Agile, or Scrum best practices.
- Don't ignore integration standards when discussing APIs or integrations.
- Don't plan work so that only one person works at a time; the team must work in parallel.
