# Change Request Update Standard

This rule governs how Change Requests are applied to existing BRD, FRD, and UAC documents.

## Core Principle

- **DO NOT create new standalone BRD/FRD/UAC files**
- **DO NOT rewrite documents from scratch** unless required for consistency
- **Update existing documents in-place** and append version updates

## Mandatory Update Approach

For EACH existing document (BRD, FRD, UAC):

1. **Add new version entry** in version history section (do not remove old history)
2. **Add "Change Request" subsection** in relevant section(s)
3. **Update impacted existing content** in-place so old rules no longer appear
4. **Keep unaffected sections unchanged**
5. **Ensure BRD ↔ FRD ↔ UAC are fully consistent**

## Version History Requirements

- Add new version row with:
  - Version: next incremental version
  - Date: current date
  - Author: BA/Product Analyst
  - Change Summary: Brief description of change
- **Never remove** existing version history entries

## Change Request Documentation

Each document must include:

- Change Request title/number
- Date of change request
- Old rule (what is being removed/changed)
- New rule (what replaces it)
- Reason for change (business justification)
- Impact summary (affected modules/features)

## Consistency Requirements

### BRD Updates Must Include:

- Version history entry
- Change Request subsection
- Updated Business Requirements (remove old, add new)
- Updated Business Rules
- Updated Scope Impact
- Updated Success Criteria

### FRD Updates Must Include:

- Version history entry
- Change Request Summary
- Updated Business Rules
- Updated Functional Scope (impacted modules)
- Updated Functional Flows
- Updated Screen/UX Requirements
- Updated Validation Rules
- Updated Permissions Model
- Updated Data Model (if applicable)
- Updated Migration/Backward Compatibility notes

### UAC Updates Must Include:

- Minimum 15 new UAC rows for the change request
- Strict CSV format: `No | Module | AS A/AN | I want to | So That | # | Questions | Acceptance Criteria`
- Append to existing UAC (do not replace)
- Post-UAC section with:
  - Missing/Unclear Requirements
  - Assumptions Made
  - Client Questions to Confirm (grouped by category)

## Edge Cases Coverage

All change requests must cover:

- Positive scenarios
- Negative scenarios
- Boundary cases
- Role-based access control
- Validation/error handling
- Migration/backward compatibility

## Document Location

- BRD: `BA Docs/Business Requirement Document/[existing filename]`
- FRD: `BA Docs/Functional Requirement Document/[existing filename]`
- UAC: `BA Docs/User Stories and Acceptance Criteria/[existing filename]`

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing updates:

- [ ] Version history updated (added, not replaced)
- [ ] Old rule removed from all documents
- [ ] New rule added consistently
- [ ] Impacted sections updated
- [ ] Unaffected sections preserved
- [ ] UAC rows added (minimum 15)
- [ ] Consistency across BRD/FRD/UAC
- [ ] No orphaned references to old rule
- [ ] Client questions documented
- [ ] Assumptions listed

## Output Style

- Client-friendly, clean business English
- Use headings and short bullets where helpful
- Keep functional clarity over technical depth
- Keep old content where still valid
- Only update impacted sections
- Explicitly mention versioned update in existing documents
