# PO Management & Xero Draft Bill Integration

Guidelines for this project's Purchase Order management and Xero draft bill sync.

## General Conventions

- Use clear, consistent naming for PO and Bill entities (e.g., `purchaseOrder`, `draftBill`).
- Document all Xero API interactions and error handling.
- Maintain audit logs for PO-to-Bill mapping and sync status.

## Integration Patterns

- Handle Xero API rate limits and retries gracefully.
- Store sync state (synced, pending, failed) with timestamps.
- Surface sync failures clearly for user visibility.
