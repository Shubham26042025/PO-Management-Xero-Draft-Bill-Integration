# BA UAC Standard

This rule governs how User Acceptance Criteria (UAC) are written for this project. Follow the strict CSV format and coverage rules.

## Mandatory Input Validation

Before writing UAC, confirm:

- Module name
- BRD approval
- FRD approval
- Mockups/UI references
- Sprint/release
- Exclusions/deferred scenarios

Do not generate UAC until module and requirements are clear.

## Coverage Rules

- For each module: produce more than 15 UAC rows.
- Cover: positive, negative, edge/boundary, role-based behavior, validations, permissions, dependency/integration failures.

## Output Format (Strict)

- Output MUST be CSV format.
- Use EXACT column headers:

```
No | Module | AS A/AN | I want to | So That | # | Questions | Acceptance Criteria
```

- Insert ONE blank row after finishing each module (empty CSV line).
- One intent (AS A/AN + I want to + So That) followed by multiple Questions and Acceptance Criteria rows; do not change intent mid-group.

## Acceptance Criteria Writing Rules

- Must be clear, testable, atomic, and verifiable.
- If outcome is binary, respond ONLY with Yes or No (no extra text).
- Keep business-readable English; avoid vague phrases like "should work correctly".

## Delivery Notes

- CSV has no borders; user can apply borders in Excel using Ctrl+A → Borders.

## Document Storage Location

All UAC documents **MUST** be saved to: `BA Docs/User Stories and Acceptance Criteria/`

See the BA Document Storage Locations rule for complete folder structure requirements.
