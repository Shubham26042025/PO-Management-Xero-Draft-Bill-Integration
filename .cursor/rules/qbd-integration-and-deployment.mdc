# QBD Integration and Deployment

## QBD APIs (Already Available)

QBD APIs are already present and operational. Do not assume they need to be built from scratch.

### Known APIs and Integrations

- **Item Inventory API** – Provides location and site information in the response.
- **Item_Site_Location_Request.xml** / **Item_Site_Location_Response.xml** – Request/response pair for item site and location data.
- **Sales_Order_By_ID_Request.xml** / **Sales_Order_By_ID_Response.xml** – Request/response pair for sales order retrieval by ID.

### Deployment

- **Initial deployment is always from Satva.**
- QBD integrations and APIs are owned and deployed by Satva.
- Reference existing XML-based request/response patterns when discussing or reviewing integrations.

## Don't

- Don't propose building new QBD APIs that already exist.
- Don't ignore the existing XML-based integration structure.
- Don't assume deployment can originate from external parties; Satva handles initial deployment.
